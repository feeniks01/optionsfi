## What is the OptionsFi Oracle?

The OptionsFi Oracle is a hybrid pricing system that combines on-chain and traditional finance (TradFi) data to provide accurate, risk-adjusted option pricing for tokenized assets.

### The Problem

Tokenized assets trade 24/7 on-chain but their volatility can diverge significantly from their TradFi counterparts due to:

- **Continuous trading** - No market hours restrictions
- **Different liquidity** - On-chain liquidity may vary from traditional markets
- **Independent price discovery** - On-chain prices can lead or lag TradFi

Using only TradFi data (like Yahoo Finance) can lead to significant mispricing of options.

### The Solution

The hybrid oracle intelligently blends:

1. **On-Chain Volatility** - Calculated from historical on-chain price movements
2. **TradFi Volatility** - From traditional market data (Yahoo Finance)
3. **Confidence Weighting** - Based on data quality and availability
4. **Risk Adjustment** - Adds buffers when divergence is high
